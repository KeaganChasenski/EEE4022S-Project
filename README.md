# Radio Wave Direction finding using LimeSDR

The Code repository provided here is for my undergraduate final-year project (EEE4022S Thesis project) at the University of Cape Town.

The aim of the project was to prototype a direction finding system for use in wildlife telemetry applications using the LimeSDR.

The project report LaTeX code can be found at [Report](https://github.com/KeaganChasenski/EEE4022S-Report)

A description of the python files and scripts for this project is given below.


## Usage

LimeUntil --find

```python
python3 direction_finding.py
```
